# Todo List App

A simple and responsive Todo List web app built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.  
This project helped me understand how to dynamically update the DOM and handle user interactions.

## Features
- Add, edit, and delete todos
- Auto-update the list without refreshing
- Responsive and clean UI
- Built using pure JavaScript (no frameworks)

## What I Learned
While building this project, I learned:
- DOM Manipulation (creating, appending, deleting elements)
- Using `querySelector()` and `createElement()`
- Handling click events and updating UI dynamically
- Managing data in arrays
- Using `addEventListener()` instead of inline event handlers
- Basic CSS styling and layout (Flexbox, gradients, hover effects)
- Working with Git and GitHub repositories
